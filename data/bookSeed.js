    description:
      "The third book in the phenomenal Thursday Next series from Number One bestselling author Jasper Fforde. In the words of one critic: 'Don't ask. Just read it.' Leaving Swindon behind her to hide out in the Well of Lost Plots (the place where all fiction is created), Thursday Next, Literary Detective and soon-to-be one parent family, ponders her next move from within an unpublished book of dubious merit entitled 'Caversham Heights'. Landen, her husband, is still eradicated, Aornis Hades is meddling with Thursday's memory, and Miss Havisham - when not sewing up plot-holes in 'Mill on the Floss' - is trying to break the land-speed record on the A409. But something is rotten in the state of Jurisfiction. Perkins is 'accidentally' eaten by the minotaur, and Snell succumbs to the Mispeling Vyrus. As a shadow looms over popular fiction, Thursday must keep her wits about her and discover not only what is going on, but also who she can trust to tell about it ... With grammasites, holesmiths, trainee characters, pagerunners, baby dodos and an adopted home scheduled for demolition, 'The Well of Lost Plots' is at once an addictively exciting adventure and an insight into how books are made, who makes them - and why there is no singular for 'scampi'.",

      "A boy discovers his neighborhood has turned into a Land of the Lawn Weenies. Sound peculiar? How about zombies behind the counter of your local hamburger stand? A roadside motel where the guests are on the menu? A party where everyone who turns up is...dead? One thing is certain: you're not in Kansas, anymore! Welcome to the PsychoZone. It's that midnight-of-the-mind place where the road to reality makes a sharp turn down a winding detour to the twisted world of the imagination. Just remember: There are no U-turns in the PsychoZone.
